## Description

This is a quiz that is dynamic in the fact that if you follow the format you can make any quiz you want. I was really challenged by two aspects in this project.One was event bubbling that cause a issue with the multiple buttons after the inital start button clicked, and the second one was local storage and where I needed to upload it and load it. I overall am really happy with this project.
